Various Unity Projects

# FPS Bouncy Shooter

This game is a work in progress, where I like to play around with the particle system. The idea is to have a 2-4 player game in the end, where "bullets" (Spheres full of particles) are able to bounce of the walls up to 3 times. This should result in a somewhat faster paced FPS where you not only have to watch out for other players, but also use your surroundings to your advantage.

# Mesh Generation

This is a project where I wanted to learn more about meshes and colliders, as well as play around with a Third Person camera and procedural generation. It is based on Brackeys Mesh Generation tutorials (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJEpeUH1EMg).

# Procedural Planets

A project created following Sebastian Lague's tutorials on Procedural Planets (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN39W020LqU&list=PLFt_AvWsXl0cONs3T0By4puYy6GM22ko8) with some minor twists of my own. 

# Visualizer

A visualizer based on the based on the tutorial of Pear Play (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Av788P9stk).
